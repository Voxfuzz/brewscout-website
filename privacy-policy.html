    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>BrewScout ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information is accessed when you use the app, how it is used, and your rights — including rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), the California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA), Canada's Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), and Quebec's Act respecting the protection of personal information in the private sector (Law 25).</p>

    <div class="highlight">
      <p><strong>The short version:</strong> BrewScout does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to our own servers. We do not have servers. All data stays on your device. The only external communication is between your device and the Google Places API and OpenStreetMap to load coffee shop details.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Information Accessed by the App</h2>

    <h3>Location Data (On-Device Only)</h3>
    <p>BrewScout requests access to your device's location to find coffee shops near you. Your location coordinates are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Precise coordinates are sent to the Google Places API and OpenStreetMap Overpass API to find nearby cafes</li>
      <li>Cached locally on your device for faster app loading and offline use</li>
      <li>Never sent to any server owned or operated by BrewScout</li>
      <li>Never stored in any database we control</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Favorites and Cached Data (On-Device Only)</h3>
    <p>When you save a coffee shop as a favorite or the app caches nearby shop data, this information is stored exclusively on your device using local storage (AsyncStorage). This data never leaves your device and is not accessible to us.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>BrewScout uses one third-party API service that receives data from your device:</p>

    <h3>Google Places API</h3>
    <p>When you view a coffee shop's detail page, the app sends a request to the Google Places API containing:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The shop's approximate location (latitude and longitude)</li>
      <li>The shop's name</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is used to retrieve photos, ratings, reviews, phone numbers, websites, and opening hours for that shop. This data is displayed in the app and not stored by us. Google's use of this data is governed by the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h3>OpenStreetMap (Overpass API)</h3>
    <p>The app queries the OpenStreetMap Overpass API with your approximate location to find nearby cafes. OpenStreetMap is a community-driven open data project. See the <a href="https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy" target="_blank">OpenStreetMap Foundation Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <p>BrewScout does not operate any servers, databases, or analytics platforms. We do not collect, store, sell, or transmit:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your name, email address, or phone number</li>
      <li>Account credentials (the app has no user accounts or login)</li>
      <li>Location history or movement patterns</li>
      <li>Usage analytics or behavioral tracking data</li>
      <li>Advertising identifiers or device fingerprints</li>
      <li>Cookies or tracking pixels</li>
      <li>Any data from other apps on your device</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Sharing and Sale</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, rent, trade, or share any personal information with third parties. Because we do not collect personal information, there is no data to share. The only data transmitted from your device is your precise location coordinates, sent directly to Google Places API and OpenStreetMap to find nearby coffee shops.</p>

    <h2>California Privacy Rights (CCPA / CalOPPA)</h2>

    <h3>Your Rights Under CCPA</h3>
    <p>If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) provides you with specific rights regarding your personal information. Because BrewScout does not collect, store, or sell any personal information, most CCPA provisions do not apply. However, for transparency:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Right to Know:</strong> You have the right to know what personal data is collected. BrewScout collects no personal data.</li>
      <li><strong>Right to Delete:</strong> You can delete all locally stored data by clearing the app's data in your device settings or by uninstalling the app.</li>
      <li><strong>Right to Opt-Out of Sale:</strong> We do not sell personal information. There is nothing to opt out of.</li>
      <li><strong>Right to Non-Discrimination:</strong> We do not discriminate against users who exercise their privacy rights.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>CalOPPA Compliance</h3>
    <p>In accordance with the California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This privacy policy is accessible from within the app and from the app's store listing</li>
      <li>You will be notified of any changes to this policy on this page</li>
      <li>You can visit this page at any time to review the current policy</li>
      <li>The effective date is listed at the bottom of this page</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Do Not Track</h3>
    <p>BrewScout does not track users in any way. We honor Do Not Track signals by default because we have no tracking mechanisms to disable. The app functions identically regardless of your browser or device's Do Not Track setting.</p>

    <h2>Canadian Privacy Rights (PIPEDA / Quebec Law 25)</h2>

    <h3>Federal Privacy Law (PIPEDA)</h3>
    <p>If you are a Canadian resident, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) governs how private-sector organizations collect, use, and disclose personal information. Because BrewScout does not collect, store, or sell any personal information, most PIPEDA provisions do not apply. For transparency:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> BrewScout takes responsibility for the limited data that passes through the app. The only data transmitted from your device is your location coordinates, sent directly to Google Places API and OpenStreetMap.</li>
      <li><strong>Identifying Purposes:</strong> Location data is used solely to find nearby independent coffee shops. It is not used for any other purpose.</li>
      <li><strong>Consent:</strong> Your consent to location access is requested by your device's operating system before the app can access it. You may withdraw consent at any time in your device settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Limiting Collection:</strong> We collect no personal information beyond what is strictly necessary for the app to function.</li>
      <li><strong>Right of Access:</strong> You have the right to request access to any personal information we hold about you. Because we hold none, there is nothing to provide.</li>
      <li><strong>Challenging Compliance:</strong> You may direct privacy-related questions or complaints to us at brewscout.reports@gmail.com. You also have the right to contact the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC) at <a href="https://www.priv.gc.ca" target="_blank">priv.gc.ca</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Quebec Privacy Law (Law 25 / Bill 64)</h3>
    <p>Quebec's Act respecting the protection of personal information in the private sector (Law 25) imposes additional requirements for Quebec residents. In compliance with Law 25:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No Personal Information Collected:</strong> BrewScout does not collect, store, or use personal information as defined under Law 25.</li>
      <li><strong>No Profiling:</strong> The app does not create profiles of individuals, does not use automated decision-making, and does not track behavior over time.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Minimization:</strong> Only the minimum data required for the app to function (your location, sent to third-party APIs) is used.</li>
      <li><strong>Third-Party Services:</strong> Location data is shared with Google Places API and OpenStreetMap solely to return nearby coffee shop results. These services have their own privacy policies linked in the Third-Party Services section above.</li>
      <li><strong>Right to Withdraw Consent:</strong> You may withdraw location permission at any time via your device settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Privacy by Design:</strong> BrewScout is built with privacy as a default — no accounts, no tracking, no servers, and no data retention.</li>
      <li><strong>Contact and Complaints:</strong> Privacy inquiries may be directed to brewscout.reports@gmail.com. Quebec residents may also contact the Commission d'accès à l'information (CAI) at <a href="https://www.cai.gouv.qc.ca" target="_blank">cai.gouv.qc.ca</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Email Reports</h2>
    <p>If you choose to report an issue or suggest a shop using the in-app report feature, the app opens your device's default email client with a pre-filled draft addressed to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="b3d1c1d6c4c0d0dcc6c79dc1d6c3dcc1c7c0f3d4ded2dadf9dd0dcde">[email&#160;protected]</a>. This email is sent through your own email account, not through any system we operate. We only receive the information you voluntarily choose to send. You can edit or delete the draft before sending.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>BrewScout does not knowingly collect any personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. The app does not require any personal information to function and does not have user accounts or registration.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since all user data is stored locally on your device and we do not operate servers or databases, the security of your data depends on your device's own security measures (such as screen lock, encryption, and OS updates). We recommend keeping your device software up to date.</p>

    <h2>Your Choices and Controls</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Location Permission:</strong> You can deny or revoke location permission at any time in your device's Settings. The app will use cached data if available.</li>
      <li><strong>Favorites:</strong> You can remove any saved favorite from within the app at any time.</li>
      <li><strong>Cached Data:</strong> You can clear all cached data by clearing the app's storage in your device settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Uninstall:</strong> Removing the app from your device permanently deletes all locally stored data including favorites and cache.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated effective date. We encourage you to review this page periodically. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
